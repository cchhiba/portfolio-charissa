      <p>I applied the below formative UX research techniques to inform my design concepts. I relied on Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics for user interface design to formulate the techniques. Under each form of research you will see a hash tag

      <p>I planned to share targeted content with the users to spark ideas and bring about inspiration. I didn’t know how best to present this content to the user so I decided to hold a co-creation workshop with a group of target users to obtain
        qualitative data. It allowed me to find a content delivery solution which was to present the information in dynamic cards. I also used the opportunity with the group, to find out what type of content inspires them.</p>

      <p>To wrap up my research, I held research interviews to delve deeper into my target users thoughts, gaining rich qualitative data. I discovered their thoughts on certain features, navigation and what visually appeals to them online.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I kept the number of questions short but asked the interviewees to elaborate on their answers. I asked them to take out their phones to show examples of websites and apps that they found visually appealing. I pressed them to talk about
        navigation flow and how they felt emotionally when using their favorite websites.</p>

      <p>Throughout the research process, I collected data which was categorized into common themes. The themes kept growing as more research was conducted. Once there was enough themes which linked back to each objective, I was able to establish
        informed insights and summarize key ideas thus creating a prototype.</p>
