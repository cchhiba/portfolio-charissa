    <div class="content-one">
      <p>In partnership with my Manager - The Project Lead, we are currently leading the redesign of the Larson Doors website, as we collaborate with stakeholders from across the business. The existing site needs a complete overhaul to better align with both evolving user needs and business goals. Together, we are driving a content-first, user-friendly redesign to create a modern, sustainable, user experience.</p>

      <h3>My Role</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-four spacing-below">
        <p>There are a lot of great minds contributing on the project. I have been assigned the role of UX Manager. My focus is on shaping part of the strategy and processes, managing the design system and building governance, and acting as the bridge between user needs and business goals. So, what exactly does that look like?</p>
        <ul class="spacing-below">
            <li>- It involves briefing the design team on the foundational and core components needed to build the Figma design system. Ensuring accessibility is added at a foundational level. Then working closely with the Lead Developer to ensure theming direction is clear for the digital design system housed in Storybook.</li><br>
            <img class="spacing-above" img src="larson-doors-components.png" alt="Parts from Larson Doors foundation and component system">
            <li>- Engaging in stakeholder interviews and workshops to understand their needs and extract customer needs for the site.</li><br>
            <img class="spacing-above" img src="larson-audience.png" alt="tbc">
            <li>-  Analyzing quantitative data to construct an initial site map. Creating mini page wireframes and flows as a visual aid for our stakeholders.</li><br>
            <img class="spacing-above" img src="larson-mini-frames.png" alt="tbc">
            <li>-  Writing detailed design and component briefs, often accompanied by wireframes. I work closely with the designers through the development process, providing constructive feedback to ensure that the user experience and behaviors are at the forefront of every design decision.</li>
            <li>-  Brief + Wireframe → Hand-oa to Designer → Design Creates Initial Design → Collaborative Development & Iteration with Feedback → Final Design Delivered</li>

            <li>-  At times, I take on the UI design work, addressing key business goals and finding a solution. For instance, one of the business needs was to promote our door series in
                a way that mirrors the experience customers would have in-store. I worked on creating a design approach that aligns the digital experience with the physical experience in store.</li>

    <div class="content-five ">
      <p>This project involves numerous teams, including Data, Commercialization, Direct to Consumer, Channel Marketing, and many others. While it’s still a work in progress I’ve already gained a wicked amount of first-hand UX/UI experience.
        I’ve had the opportunity to push the boundaries of my role, often blurring the lines between design strategy and execution, while continually adapting to meet the changing needs of the business. I’ve learned how to navigate complex workflows, not to mention spent hours problem-solving, and having fun collaborating with a great bunch of people.
        I’m really looking forward to seeing the website go live and seeing the value and growth come from the teams hard work.</p>

      <h3>The Product</h3>

    <div class="content-six">
      <p>We named our product Pushplayback, and our objective was to celebrate our customers accomplishments by using data to design an immersive online experience of the past year. The interactive review aimed to honor the significant milestones and demonstrate the value they achieved throughout the past year by utilizing our product. </p>

      <h3>Our Strategy</h3>

    <div class="content-seven">
      <p>The team created a business plan which included:</p><br>
      <ul class="spacing-below">
        <li>- Business impact statement which outlined the customers and business benefits.</li><br>
        <li>- Go to the market timeline.</li><br>
        <li>-  Technical implementation plan (engineering).</li><br>
        <li>-  Future products we could build off the Pushplayback.</li>

        <h3>My Role</h3>
      </div>

    <div class="content-eight">
        <p>I collaborated with two other designers to conceptualize and create Pushplayback. Despite the time constraints, we prioritized user experience throughout the design process. Our aim was to present the customers metrics in a way that would engage and delight the user. Initially, we conducted research on other companies producing similar products to gather design inspiration. After discussions, we decided on a feed view as the primary interface for customers to view their achievements, and we swiftly began designing each frame. I delved into researching how to create animated prototypes using Figma. Once the product design was finalized, I incorporated animations to enhance the user experience, introducing joyful movements, a sliding carousel, and interactive elements such as a click-through carousel.</p>

    <div class="content-title-nine">
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-nine">
      <p>It was a challenge having all of us work remotely across different time-zones. We realized communication was going to be key to our success. To remedy this, we met twice daily and broke out into sub groups, such as design, business implementation, engineering and others. We also created a slack channel for our team and a shared Figma collaboration board which we could all edit and contribute to.</p>

      <p>Users are taken to their admin dashboard in the Pushpays, church management software where they can then select a button to view their recap. See the final product we presented here. Make sure to move the carousel and click through the bread crumbs.</p>

        <p>Fast track award: signifies that the product idea has earned a place on the company road map for future production.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I had a great time collaborating during the hackathon! I established valuable connections and deepened my understanding for other departments, some of which including engineering and data migration. It allowed me to gain a cross-functional understanding with the organization and insights into the other departments' unique needs and challenges. I had the opportunity to brush up on my presentation skills as I communicated the design to the wider team. I increased my customer knowledge and my figma prototyping skills. Overall it was a great success and I can’t wait to attend another one. </p>
