    <div class="content-four spacing-below">
        <p>During the hackathon, I had the opportunity to collaborate and learn from professionals across various disciplines, including marketers, engineers, and product managers. It was a unique experience as job titles were set aside, and we worked together as a cohesive team. We focused on creating a year-in-review experience that showcased key insights and metrics from our customers' product usage.</p>

    <div class="content-five ">
      <p>“To create an engaging, shareable and informative year-in-review experience for customers that showcase Pushpays value in a joyful way that works to increase revenue and reduce churn.”</p>

      <h3>The Product</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-six">
      <p>We named our product Pushplayback, and our objective was to celebrate our customers accomplishments by using data to design an immersive online experience of the past year. The interactive review aimed to honor the significant milestones and demonstrate the value they achieved throughout the past year by utilizing our product. </p>

      <h3>Our Strategy</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-seven">
      <p>The team created a business plan which included:</p><br>
      <ul class="spacing-below">
        <li>Business impact statement which outlined the customers and business benefits.</li><br>
        <li>Go to the market timeline.</li><br>
        <li>Technical implementation plan (engineering).</li><br>
        <li>Future products we could build off the Pushplayback.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="content-title-eight">
        <h3>My Role</h3>
      </div>

    <div class="content-eight">
        <p>I collaborated with two other designers to conceptualize and create Pushplayback. Despite the time constraints, we prioritized user experience throughout the design process. Our aim was to present the customers metrics in a way that would engage and delight the user. Initially, we conducted research on other companies producing similar products to gather design inspiration. After discussions, we decided on a feed view as the primary interface for customers to view their achievements, and we swiftly began designing each frame. I delved into researching how to create animated prototypes using Figma. Once the product design was finalized, I incorporated animations to enhance the user experience, introducing joyful movements, a sliding carousel, and interactive elements such as a click-through carousel.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-title-nine">
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-nine">
      <p>It was a challenge having all of us work remotely across different time-zones. We realized communication was going to be key to our success. To remedy this, we met twice daily and broke out into sub groups, such as design, business implementation, engineering and others. We also created a slack channel for our team and a shared Figma collaboration board which we could all edit and contribute to.</p>

      <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-ten">
      <p>Users are taken to their admin dashboard in the Pushpays, church management software where they can then select a button to view their recap. See the final product we presented here. Make sure to move the carousel and click through the bread crumbs.</p>

        <br>
        <p>I had a great time collaborating during the hackathon! I established valuable connections and deepened my understanding for other departments, some of which including engineering and data migration. It allowed me to gain a cross-functional understanding with the organization and insights into the other departments' unique needs and challenges. I had the opportunity to brush up on my presentation skills as I communicated the design to the wider team. I increased my customer knowledge and my figma prototyping skills. Overall it was a great success and I can’t wait to attend another one. </p>
