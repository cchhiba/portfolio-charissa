      <p>In partnership with the project lead, we redesigned a door retailers’ website, as we collaborated with stakeholders from across the business.

      <h3>My Role</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-three">
        <p>There are a lot of great minds that contributed on the project. I had been assigned the role of <span class="website-sub">UX Manager</span>. My focus is was on shaping part of the strategy and processes, managing the design system, and acting as the bridge between the user and business goals. <span class="website-sub">So, what exactly does that look like?</span></p>

    <div class="content-four">
      <p>It involved briefing the design team on the foundational and core components needed to build the Figma design system. Ensuring accessibility is added at a foundational level. Then working closely with the lead developer to ensure theming direction is clear for the digital design system housed in Storybook.</p>

    <div class="content-seven">
        <p>Writing detailed design and component briefs, often accompanied by wireframes. I worked closely with the designers through the development process, providing constructive feedback to ensure that the user experience and behaviors were at the forefront of every design decision.</p>

    <div class="content-nine">
      <p>At times, I took on the UI design work, addressing key business goals and finding solutions. For instance, one of the business needs was to promote our door series in a way that mirrors the experience customers would have in-store. I worked on creating a design approach that aligns the digital experience with the physical experience in store.</p>

      <h3>The Result</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-twelve spacing-below">
        <p>This project involves numerous teams, including Data, Commercialization, Direct to Consumer, Channel Marketing, and many others. I was able to gain a wicked amount of first-hand UX/UI experience.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I’ve had the opportunity to push the boundaries of my role, often blurring the lines between design strategy and execution, while adapting to meet the changing needs of the business. I’ve learned how to navigate complex workflows, not to mention spent hours problem-solving, and having fun collaborating with a great bunch of people.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I’m really looking forward to seeing the website go live and seeing the value and growth come from the teams hard work.</p>
