      <p>The Design System team's goal is to enable the Sharesies product teams to efficiently create inclusive, cohesive, and engaging experiences that put investors in control of their financial future.</p>
      <br>
      <p>My challenge was to provide guidelines and standardize a set of reusable user interface components for other teams to use at scale. This included porting form components from the web application to the design system, and then integrating
        them back into the web application.</p>

    <div class="content-three">
      <p>I collaborated closely with the UX/UI Designers to ensure the design and naming conventions were carefully considered. We discussed the components in detail, taking a holistic approach as we explored how we can future-proof the component. I
        also worked closely with the Senior Developers as we discusses and reviewed the sustainability of the code. </p>

      <h3>Design System</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-five">
      <p>I would extract react class components from the web application and port them over into the design system repository where I would convert them into functional components. This included working with JSX, TypeScript, and Sass. Each component
        is wrapped within Formik functions and uses global Sass styling. I had to be careful with how I structured each component and take the global functions and styling into consideration.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Components are displayed in a user interface called Storybook, for the wider teams to access and utilize. Storybook requires a ‘story’ file to be written for each component to display it, along with its different variants and states.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Once the functionality and accessibility of the component were complete, I would test the function using the Jest testing library, which works well with the React framework. Each component would receive a 100% success rate before moving through to the next stage.</p>

      <h3>Documentation</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-seven">
      <p>Zeroheights is used to display the documentation for the design system. It allows users to plugin Storybook and Figma token files. Documenting is an integral part of the design system as the design system team believes in having a single
        source of truth for code and design.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Before creating an npm package for a component, I would write detailed documentation which outlined guidelines around usage, code, and design. I wrote technical development considerations and ‘do’s and don't.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Once the content was reviewed by the team, I would announce the release to the wider teams using Slack and during ‘all-team’ presentation meetings.</p>

      <h3>Web application</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-nine">
      <p>The old class component instances would be removed from the web application and replaced with the design system version. This process required rigorous testing as I didn't want the new component to cause any front and back-end changes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I used a Taiko repository to test the instances of the new component in the web application. This meant I had to write end-to-end tests for the user flows that used the component. This checked the functionality of the component. I wrote tests
        that included taking snapshot images throughout the user flow.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I then used the snapshots with a visual diffing tool called Percy which allowed me to review a snapshot of the change before and after it was made. It overlaid the images to hone in on any visual discrepancies.</p>
