      <h3>Overview</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-one">
      <p>Athleisurewear brand, Marlow launched in 2020 with their first spring/summer collection. The Director of the company approached me with the task of shaping the creative direction for autumn/winter and designing and developing the collection.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>I designed a 31 piece collection, along with a separate 5 piece knitwear capsule to be dropped in stores and online throughout autumn and winter 2021.</p>

      <h3>Creative Direction</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-five">
      <p>The overall feeling of the collection relates to finding a sense of calm and balance. Noting the small things arounds us. Finding beauty in every day objects such as the seam lines of a basket ball and the outlines and patterns found in tree
        bark. It's about slowing down and appreciating the world around us. Finding a balance between home-life, work and leisure.</p>
      <br>
      <img class="spacing-below" src="/assets/marlow-aw21.png" alt="marlow aw21 write up">
      <p>Common themes found through the collection:</p>
      <br>
      <ul class="spacing-below">
        <li>- Shape: trans-seasonal dressing from season to season.</li>
        <li>- Silhouette: classic styles with a modern take.</li>
        <li>- Functionality: active wear acting as day wear.</li>
        <li>- Structure: fluidity and form to be gentle with subtle movement.</li>
        <li>- Texture: smooth, gritty knits.</li>
        <li>- Detail: elevated through subtle details such as line and contrast.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conceptualization</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-six">
      <p>Once the creative direction had been approved, I moved on to hand drawing concepts. Hundreds of drawings were created, as I iterated each piece in the collections. I created outfit boards to assess the collection as a whole. Looking at how
        each piece worked in with one another. Styling the collection in this way makes for a strong collection, ensuring each piece has a purpose and is different enough that the consumer would want to buy several pieces of the collection to outfit
        with. There is a mixture of fashion pieces and timeless basics. The basics are designed to be repeated in future collections, becoming Marlow staples.</p>

      <h3>Development</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-seven">
      <p>When the collection was designed and approved, I created computerized sketches and technical design sheets for each garment to be sent to the factory. When the factory had produced the prototype samples, I worked with the Director and
        Garment Technician to fit each sample on a model. Once we finalized the fit and design of each sample, we gave the factories the approval to start production.</p>

      <h3>Result</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="content-eight">
      <p>The collection was sold online and in store. The collection sold really well and a selection of the knitwear styles were made ‘best-seller’ and repeated the next collections.</p>
